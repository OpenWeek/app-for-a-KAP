# Intro general
dialogIntro1=Welcome to Kapotopia !
dialogIntro2=Here, you'll learn important informations on sexuality and its risks in order to better protect yourself.
dialogIntro3=The first world contains two tests about your knowledge on STI : their names and symptoms.\nThe second world will teach you the safe and unsafe sexual practices.\nAnd finally the STI-dex, it is simply an encyclopedia to learn everything about our ennemies, the STIs.
# Intro Game 1
dialogG1_1=Hi ! I was waiting for you ! I'm Mireille, your condom-pal.
dialogG1_2=If you're here, it's because like me, you have to redo your exams.\nThis year, the tests are done in pairs. I'm counting on you to help me succeed !
dialogG1_3=As you're new here, i hope the trials won't be to hard for you. The instructors tend to be a bit blunt...
dialogG1_4=Oh speak of the devil, watch out, Sergeant Dildo's coming, we'd better shut up before we get put into the hole.
dialogG1_5=Greetings, recruits. Welcome to the Infectious Jungle of Chilly Beachy! Here, you will show me your skills to identify our longtime enemies: the terrible STI!
dialogG1_6=Let's not beat around the bush, let's go for a warm-up: a little jog in the infectious jungle.\nBeware of the STI wandering around in the jungle, don't let any escape!
dialogG1_7=Okay bidet bottom scrapers, show me what you got!
dialogG1_rules_1=Your goal here is to quickly identify real STI and catch them before they hit the ground.\nMove Mireille around on the different roads in order to do that. You'll be rewarded for every STI you catch.\nWarning: not all creatures falling from trees are STI! You're not empowered to catch them, so you'll lose a life if you do.\nAfter three lives lost, you start the adventure all over again.\n\nAnd if you find the warm-up too easy, you can always try the higher difficulty.
# Game 1
intro_text=Well done! Unfortunately, you forgot to catch the following STI:
game1_outro1=Well, it wasn't easy, but I passed the first test thanks to you. Let's go to the next one, to the beach this time!

game2_diag1=Warm sand, sunny sky, seagulls flying around, man-eating sharks, no doubt we are at the beach!
game2_diag2=Oh look over there! Looks like we're expected!
game2_diag3=Hi! I'm Alix. In case you don't recognize me, I'm a dental dam. Now that you're up to your neck in endurance, thanks to Sergeant Dildo, I'm taking you to the beach to play Kapotopia's national sport, basketball! Yes, it also takes a good dose of agility to be a good certified protector...
game2_rules=The purpose of this test is to learn the symptoms of each STI. Throw the ball corresponding to an STI into the basket with the correct symptoms.\nStart by selecting a ball by touching it, then throw it by swipping it up.\nYou can also change the presented symptom by swiping left or right.\nEach mistake will cost you a life. If you run out of life, you will have to restart the game.

game3_diag4=But, but... this place is infested with STIs! I got the wrong address!
game3_diag5=Hello, I'm Thomas GODIVA. Are you a condom?\nSTI are my friends and we don't like your kind around here.\nYou'd better get out of here fast, we have pins to settle your score!
game3_instr=Hurry, you must run, or you'll get pierced!\nThis door is electronically locked. To unlock it, rotate each cell of the maze to connect the battery to the right lock!\nEach lock is associated with a risky practice, or not, tap on it to display it.\n\nWarning: Only one lock works. You must find the non-hazardous practice, the others won't work!

game3_win_tom=Bravo! Here, take a chocolate to comfort you, hoping it will help you for the next challenge.
game3_loose=Unfortunately you didn't manage to get away...

game4_diag1=Finally, I was able to leave this weird place, but where am I? ... It looks like I'm at the back of the building ...
game4_diag2=But what's going on here? There are lots of STIs that keep spreading !
game4_diag3=This is the territory of my STI friends! Everything that happens here helps them to propagate. See with your own eyes how it happens!
game4_rules=In this game you play as an STI. You have to recognize the risky practices that help you to spread.\nSelect the STI you are interested in, move with the arrows, collect the risky practices that help its transmission and avoid the protections as well as the practices that prevent the chosen STI from spreading.\n\nYou will be rewarded or penalized according to the practices you collect.
